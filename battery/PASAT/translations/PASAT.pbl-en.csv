inst1,"In this task, you will see or hear a series of numbers.  After each number, you need to add it to the last number you saw, and click the the number corresponding to this sum.  For example, if the first number was 7, and the second number was 3 you would click 10.  When the next number is presented, add it to the next most recent number.  So, after you see 3 and click 10, if the next number were 5, you would add 5 to 3, and click 8.  We will start with a short practice round."
