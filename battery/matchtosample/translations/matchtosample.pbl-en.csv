inst1,"During the course of this experiment, you will see a single matrix filled with red and yellow squares, followed by a pair of matrices. Your task is to decide which of the matrices in the pair match the single matrix you were shown first.  At the start of a trial you will see a single matrix made up of red and yellow cells. This is the sample matrix for the trial. You should do your best to memorize the pattern of red and yellow squares in this matrix.  After you have memorized the sample matrix, press anky key on the keyboard, and the sample matrix will be removed from the screen. After a short pause, you will then see two comparison matrices on the screen, side by side One of these two matrices will be identical to the sample matrix that was on the screen, and the other matrix will differ slightly.  Your task is to determine which of the two comparison matrices is the one which matches the sample matrix. If you think the matrix on the left matches the sample matrix, press the left shift key; if you think the matrix on the right matches the sample matrix, press right shift key. You should try to decide which matrix matches the sample one as quickly as you can while still being accurate. If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter now.\n\n\nPress any key to begin"
