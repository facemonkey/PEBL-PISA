The PEBL Plus-minus task. A task of executive function and switching.

The task compares the time and accuracy for adding or subtracting versus interleaved adding and subtracting.  It is modeled after the task used by Miyake et al (2000).  Experimenters can choose to use longer lists, or add/subtract a value other than 3 from each stimulus number.
