inst1,"This task involves some simple math problems.  First, you will be shown a series <SIZE> 2-digit numbers.  For each number, you must add <N> to it, and enter the response.  For example, if you see the number 18, add <N> to it and enter <SUM>.  Complete the problems as quickly and accurately as possible."
inst2,"Now, you will be shown another series of 2-digit numbers.  For each number, you must SUBTRACT <N> from it, and enter the response.  For example, if you see the number 18, subtract <N> from it and enter <DIFF>.  Complete the problems as quickly and accurately as possible."
instSwap,"Finally, you will be shown another series of 2-digit numbers.  Now, you must either add or subtract <N> from the number and enter the response.  For the first number, add <N>,  for the next number, subtract <N>.  Repeat this pattern throughout.  Try to remember which math operation you are supposed to do, but if you lose track, the message at the bottom of the screen will remind you. Complete the problems as quickly and accurately as possible."
