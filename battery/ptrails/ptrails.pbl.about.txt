The PEBL Trail-making test (ptrails) 

This is a simple connect-the-dots task, which compares a pure (number or letter only) with switch (alternating number and letter) problem.  The test uses randomly-generated problems multiple times (under both A and B conditions), to give a better measure of switch costs, and to enable repeated testing.
