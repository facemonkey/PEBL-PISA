and then another square.

At the end of each set of symmetry pictures and squares, a recall
screen will appear. Use the mouse to select the squares
you just saw. Try your best to get the squares in the
correct order.

It is important to work QUICKLY and ACCURATELY on the symmetry
problems. Make sure you know the answer to the symmetry problem
before clicking to the next screen. You will not be told if
your answer regarding the symmetry problem is correct.

After the recall screen, you will be given feedback about
your performance regarding both the number of squares
recalled and the percent correct on the symmetry problems.
