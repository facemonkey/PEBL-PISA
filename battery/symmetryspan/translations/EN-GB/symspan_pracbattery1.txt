Now you will practice doing both parts of the task at the
same time.

In the next practice set, you will be given a symmetry problem.
Once you make your decision about the problem, a square will
appear on the screen. Try and remember the position of the square.

In the previous section where you only did the symmetry problems,
the computer computed your average time to solve the problems.
If you take longer than your average time, the computer will
automatically move you onto the next square part, thus skipping
the True or False part and will count that problem as a symmetry
error. Therefore it is VERY important to solve the symmetry problems
as quickly and as accurately as possible.
