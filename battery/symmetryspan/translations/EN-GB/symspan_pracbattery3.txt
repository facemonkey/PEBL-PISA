During the feedback, you will see a number in blue in
the top right of the screen. This indicates your
percent correct for the math problems for the entire
experiment.

It is VERY important for you to keep this at least at 85%.
For our purposes, we can only use data where the
participant was at least 85% accurate on the symmetry pictures.

Therefore, in order for you to be asked to come back for
future experiments, you must perform at least at 85% on
the symmetry problems WHILE doing your best to recall as
many letters as possible.
