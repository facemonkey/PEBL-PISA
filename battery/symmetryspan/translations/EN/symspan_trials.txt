That is the end of the practice.

The real task will look like the practice trials you
just completed. First you will get a symmetry problem,
then a square to remember.
<blank>
When you see the recall screen, select the squares in
the order presented. If you forget a square, click the
BLANK box to mark where it should go. Some of the sets will
have more problems and squares than others.
<blank>
It is important that you do your best on both the symmetry
problems and the square recall parts of this experiment.
<blank>
Remember for the symmetry problems you must work as QUICKLY and
ACCURATELY as possible. Also, remember to keep your symmetry
accuracy at 85% or above.
