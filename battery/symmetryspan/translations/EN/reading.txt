Now you will practice the sentence reading part of this task.
<blank>
A sentence will appear on your screen that will look
like this:
<blank>
		I like to run in the park.
<blank>
As soon as you see the sentence, you should read it and work
out if it makes sense or not. The above sentence makes sense.

An example of a sentence that does not make sense would be:

		I like to run in the sky.

When you have read the sentence and worked out if it makes
sense or not, you will click the mouse button.
