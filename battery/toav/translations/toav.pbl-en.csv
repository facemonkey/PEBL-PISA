inst1,"You are about to take part in an experiment that involves attending to stimuli on a screen.  It will take approximately 24 minutes.\n\n  On each trial, you will see one of two stimuli on the screen. Each will be a white square with a black square inside it.  On some trials, this inner square will be near the top of the white square; on other trials it will be near the bottom. Press any key to see the stimuli."
inst2,"When the square is on the top, it is a target.  During the task, you should press the space bar whenever you see the target stimulus.   Press any key to continue."
inst3,"When the square is on the bottom, it is NOT a target.  During the task, you should not press the space bar when the non-target is displayed.   Press any key to continue."
inst4,"During the task, you will see a series of targets and non-targets.  Press the space bar as quickly as you can whenever you see a target (top square).  Do nothing when you see a non-target (bottom square).  The task lasts approximately 24 minutes, so you need to concentrate on the task in order to perform well.\n\nPress the space bar to begin."
