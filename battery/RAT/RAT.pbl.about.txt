  Note that this is divided into three subsets of about 20 problems each.
  (easy-med-diff).  This can take up to 30s for each problem, so the entire
  test can take more than 30 minutes.

  you can specify whether you want to do easy/medium/difficult
  You can also mix the problems together or do them separately.
  if maxprobs < the total number of given problems, problems are
  sampled randomly from the individual sets.
