inst1,"In this task you will be monitoring a number of displays which are intended to have the appearance of electromechanical dials like those on a machine. The dials consist of six pointer positions and a pointer which appears below the positions and moves from one to another.     Under normal conditions the pattern of pointer movement is random.    The pointer is equally likely to move to any position.  Periodically the pointer movement on one of the dials will become nonrandom, such that the pointer will tend to stay on one side of the dial more than the other.    Your task is to watch the dials carefully for nonrandom or 'biased' patterns of pointer movement. Biases in pointer movement are called 'signals.'  If you think you see a signal, press the key on the keyboard that corresponds to the dial (1, 2, or 3).  When you correctly respond to a signal,  it is eliminated and the pointer goes back to moving randomly again. \nPress any key to continue."
inst2,"Monitoring periods last up to 5 minutes each.  Each period will last 5 minutes or until you see 10 signals (biases). Once a signal begins, it will stay on until you respond.  When you make a response, feedback will be presented briefly indicating whether the response was correct (a hit) or incorrect (false alarm if no signal was present, or miss if you responded to an incorrect signal). Two signals will never appear on different dials at the same time. Try to avoid responding unless you are confident that a signal is present.  On different trials, you will monitor either one, two, or three dials. \n\nPress any key to begin"
