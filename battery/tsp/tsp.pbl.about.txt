PEBL Traveling Salesman Problem.  Participants solve TSP problems to 
judge efficiency and speed of spatial reasoning and planning.

By default, a 15-problem subset is used that can be completed in under ten minutes, 
with reliability normative values established by Mueller et al (in submission). Other uses 
are also described in that manuscript.

The problems are stored in the tours\ folder, and can be created from 
Concorde saved files using the code in  tours\processTSPFile.R.

Additional TSP problems are in tours\tours2.zip and tours\TSP.zip
