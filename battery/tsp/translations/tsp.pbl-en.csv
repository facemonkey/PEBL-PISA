instIntro,"In this test, your goal is to draw a path through all of the points on the screen on the shortest path possible, returning to your starting point.  Start at the grey circle, move through each point by <INPUT>ing on it, and make sure you return to the first point at the very end. We will start with a sample trial. Remember, you don't need to <INPUT> the first grey circle. Now, <INPUT> continue to start the example."

inst3, "Great.  The feedback shows you the best path through the points, and how much worse you did than the shortest possible route.  If you score an efficiency value of 1.0, you found the shortest possible route.  Now, try a few more practice tests. \n\n <INPUT> continue to begin."
inst4,"Work through each sample problem, trying to find the most efficient path."
inst5,"Now, you will solve some more difficult problems.  You probably won't find the shortest path, but do as good of a job as you can.  Remember, we are measuring BOTH how efficient your path is and how fast you solve the problem, so try to be both fast and efficient. Now, <INPUT> continue to begin."
