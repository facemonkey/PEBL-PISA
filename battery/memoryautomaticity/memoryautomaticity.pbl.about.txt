PEBL Memory Automaticity Task
A simple implementation of the Shiffrin & Schneider (1977) automaticity
task.  In this task, the participant performs Sternberg-style memory search to
achieve automaticity.  In its current form, it is essentially a demo, and only performs one round within an individual task.
