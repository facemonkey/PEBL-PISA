inst1,"This task involves learning to classify a letter based on whether it is in a memory set.  First, you will be given a memory set of one or more letters.  Remember this list. Once you have committed the list to memory, you will be shown a series of letters, and you have to decide whether each letter matches one of the letters in the set. When it does not match, respond using <LEFT>. When it matches, respond using <RIGHT>.  \nFor example, if you were asked to remember the letters ABC, when you see A, you should respond using <RIGHT>, but if you see Q, you would respond using <LEFT>.  After a set of letters, you will see a new memory set, and have to respond based on the new set of letters."
