test1|consonants-av|First dimension. Is made up of two parts: the stimulus type (consonants or numbers) and the modality (-a, -v, or -av) or 'none' (not in quotes).  I.e., consonants-a for auditory consonants.
test2|squares|Secondary nback dimension. either squares or none (which is a single-d n-back)
nMin|1|Shortest N to test
nMax|3|Longest N to test
isi|3000|ISI of stimuli, in ms
dim1targs|4|In each block, how many targets match only on dimension-1 
dim2targs|4|In each block, how many targets match only on dimension-2
bothtargs|2|In each block, how many targets match both d1 and d2
trialsperblock|20|Total trials per block.  Should be greater than sum of dim1targs,dim2targs, and bothtargs.
