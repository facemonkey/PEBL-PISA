inst1,"In this task, you  will see a series of 'P's and 'R's on the screen. Whenever you see a 'P', respond by pressing the right shift key on the keyboard.  DO NOT RESPOND when you see an 'R'.  Most of the letters you see will be 'P's. You will begin with a few practice trials.  Press the right shift key to begin."
inst2,"Now, you will do the task for real. You will no longer be told when you make an error. Press any key to begin."
inst3,"You may take a short break before you continue.  In the second half of this study, the mapping will reverse.  This time, hit the right shift key only when you see the 'R', but not when you see a 'P'. Once again, most of the letters you see will  be 'P's. You will begin with a few practice trials.  Press the right shift key to begin."
