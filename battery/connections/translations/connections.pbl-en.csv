timeinsta,"There will be a time limit to complete this test. You will have "

inst1a,"In this task, you will need to connect a set of circles that are labeled with numbers and letters. In different versions of the task, you will connect them based on a sequence of numbers (1-2-3-4), letters (A-B-C-D), or an alternating sequence (1-A-2-B).  For trials using letters, it will go through the alphabet twice, putting a * beside each letter the second time through.  The next circle in the sequence will always be next to the previous one, either above, below, left, right, or diagonally.  "
inst1b," Practice the short test below, in which you will follow the numbers 1-2-3-4-5.  Click the highlighted '1' circle to begin."
inst2,"Sometimes, the test will require you to use an alternating pattern of letters and numbers, either A-1-B-2 etc., or 1-A-2-B etc.  The type of test will be labeled at the bottom of the screen.  Try a second trial with the alternating letters."
inst3a,"Now, you will do the real test, which contains a "
inst3b," grid.  Before each test, you will see the instructions at the bottom of the screen.  Click the screen to begin."
