About:
The PEBL Psychological Test Battery is a set of psychological
tests available for the PEBL Experiment Building Language
(http://pebl.sourceforge.net).  The consist of freely usable and
modifiable versions of commonly-used psychological tests. They will
run on Microsoft Windows, OSX, or Linux operating systems.  

Each directory contains one or more related .pbl files that define a
specific task.  Tasks should be run using the PEBL launcher, which can
be run from the main menu.  Within the launcher, select a .pbl file
and run it to administer a test.  Once completed, the data from any
test will be saved in a subdirectory of the test you ran.
