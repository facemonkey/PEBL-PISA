A PEBL Stroop Demo.
This task is was initially distributed with PEBL, but is mostly a demonstration of how different response modalities produce different opposite effects.  See
http://peblblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/stroop-test.html for discussion.
The new color-stroop.pbl or stroop.vic.pbl are recommended for psychometric evaluation of attentional filtering.
