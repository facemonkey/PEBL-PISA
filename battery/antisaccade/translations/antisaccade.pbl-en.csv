inst1,"In this task, you will try to see the direction an arrow is facing.  Each trial will start with a cross at the center of the screen.  Then, a square will appear either on the left or right side of the screen.  DO NOT LOOK AT THE FIRST SQUARE.  Shortly after the square appears, another square will appear on the opposite side of the screen containing an arrow.  This arrow will either be facing left, right, up, or down.  Shortly after the arrow appears, it will disappear and be replaced by a small hashed square.  Try very hard to look to where the square will be, and not where the first square is.  We will start with a few trials where it is easy to see the targets. To respond, use the arrow keys on the keyboard to indicate the direction of the arrow.\n\nYou will start with an easy practice block."
inst2,"Now we will do a practice block that will be more difficult. The arrow will appear immediately after the first square, and disappear very quickly.  In order to see the arrow, you must try to not look at the first square, and instead glance toward where the arrow will be."
inst3,"Now, your responses will count for real. Try to answer as accurately as you can. Press OK to begin."
