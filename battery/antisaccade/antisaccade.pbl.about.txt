The PEBL Anti-saccade task. 

Based roughly on Miyake's method.  This task requires suppressing an automatic eye movement to a prompt to detect an arrow stimulus in the opposite direction. 

Experimenters should adjust timing and spacing parameters so that accuracy is above 60%; otherwise performance can be improved by cheating (not looking at the fixation and looking only at one side).
