PEBL Move-to-target task. ("whack-a-mole") 


This task requires the user to move to a target within a time limit; immediately after that the target appears elsewhere. In addition, if the target isn't hit in time, it will disappear.

After the first trial of 30 targets, the mapping will change.  this is similar to the tracking task.
