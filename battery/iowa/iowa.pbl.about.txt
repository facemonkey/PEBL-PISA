PEBL's "Bechara Gambling Task": an independent implementation of Bechara et al.'s so-called "Iowa Gambling Task". Choose which option and receive rewards and costs.  This version, by Peter Bull, is a substantial improvement over the original PEBL test, which is still available as iowa-old.pbl if needed.
