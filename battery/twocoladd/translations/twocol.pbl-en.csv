inst, "This test examines your ability to perform mathematical calculations.   The computer will present you with two column addliton problems that you are to add as rapidly as possible.  The answer must be given by entering the left hand digit first (usually the hundreds' or tens' digit) followed by the remaining digits. Once you make an entry the math problem will disappear. Therefore, it is very important that you know the entire answer to the problem before making an entry. If you make a mistake you can use the back space key to correct it. When you are satisfied with your answer, press the return key.\n\n       Example:  \n                    29\n                    32\n                    13\n                   ____\n                   ?\nHere you would press the 7-key; then the 4-key; then the return key. Remember to work as quickly and as accurately as possible. It you fail torespond in 15 seconds the problem will disappear and a new problem will be shown.\n\nPress any key to begin."
