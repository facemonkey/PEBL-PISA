The real task will look like the practice trials you
just completed. First you will get a sentence to read,
then a letter to remember.

When you see the recall screen, select the letters in
the order presented. If you forget a letter, click the
BLANK box to mark where it should go.

Some of the sets will have more sentences and letter
than others.

It is important that you do your best on both the sentence
problems and the letter recall parts of this experiment.

<blank>
Remember for the sentences you must work as QUICKLY and
ACCURATELY as possible. Also, remember to keep your sentence
accuracy at 85% or above.
