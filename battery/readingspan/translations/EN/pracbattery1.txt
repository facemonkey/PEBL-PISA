Now you will practice doing both parts of the task at the

In the next practice set, you will be given one sentence to read.
Once you make your decision about the sentence,a letter will
appear on the screen. Try and remember the letter.

In the previous section where you only read the sentences,
the computer computed your average time to read the sentences.
If you take longer than your average time, the computer will
automatically move you onto the next letter part, thus skipping
the True or False part and will count that problem as a sentence
error. Therefore it is VERY important to read the sentences as
quickly and as accurately as possible.
