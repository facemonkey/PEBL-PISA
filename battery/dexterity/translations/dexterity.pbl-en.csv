inst1,"In this test, your goal is to move the cursor to the target location.  When you move the mouse around, it will change color to give you additional information about how far you have to go.  The cursor will 'jitter' around making it difficult to exactly move to the target.  In addition, it will drift back toward the center if you do not move it. By moving your mouse around, your goal is to move to the target as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n    Press the mouse button to continue."
