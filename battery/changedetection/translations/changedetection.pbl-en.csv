Notice how the red circle moves from one location to another.  \n\nPress any key to see the two screens cycle."
inst2,"In the real tests, there are different ways the screens can change: a circle might disappear, change color, change size, or change position.  There will be more circles, and so the change will be much harder to find, but there will one circle that changes on each display.  \nOnce you have located the change, press the space bar, and then click on the screen at the location of the change.  Then, a new trial will begin.\n\nPress any key to begin."
