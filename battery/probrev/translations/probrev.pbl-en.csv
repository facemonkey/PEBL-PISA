inst1,"You are about to take part in an experiment that involves learning a rule. On each trial, you will see two abstract images containing shapes of different colors.  On each trial, we will have selected one of the stimuli according to some rule.  Your task is to choose which stimulus is correct.  After you choose, we will tell you if you are correct or incorrect by showing you either a green smiley face (correct) or a red frown face (incorrect).  However, the feedback you get will not always be correct.  To choose the stimulus on the left, press the left shift key; to choose the stimulus on the right, choose the right shift key. \n\nPress any key to begin."
