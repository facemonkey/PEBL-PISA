inst,"In this task, you will see one, two, or three cards like the ones below.  Each card has a different chance of predicting sunshine or rain, and based on the cards you see, you need to make a prediction about what the cards predict. Some of the cards are better predictors of a sunny day; others are better predictors of rain. When multiple good predictors of rain are seen together, there is a greater chance of rain, and similarly, when multiple predictors of sun appear together, there is a greater chance of sun.  However, even when the cards indicate a strong chance of rain (or sun) it won't always happen.  Try to learn which cards predict which outcome, and make your best guess on each trial. \nYou will a point for every prediction you get correct, and lose a point for every prediction you get wrong. Your running points will be shown in the graph below.\n\n Press any key to begin."
