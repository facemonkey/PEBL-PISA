This directory contains various complete and semi-complete experiment
scripts.  More mature experiments are found in the PEBL test battery.



PEBL scripts are designed to be run from a shortcut to a special
front-end launcher.  The launcher can be run from the start menu, or a
shortcut for the launcher is located in My
Documents\pebl-exp.09.  Whe you run the launcher, it will open up a
launcher window with the available script files visible in the window.
To launch a script, select the script in the upper right box, set
whatever options you want (like turn on or off fullscreen execution),
and hit "Run PEBL Script".

The script will execute, and will often produce output related to
script execution or data collection.  These will appear in the "User
Output (stdout.txt)" and the "Errors and Messages (stderr.txt)" output
panels. 

A number of scripts are provided in pebl-exp.0.09 and its
subdirectories. Many of these are just test scripts for various
aspects of PEBL, and so are not interesting unless you want to learn
how to program new experiments. In addition, a copy of the PEBL test
battery 0.3 is in My Documents\pebl-exp.0.09\battery, (although it can
also be downloaded independently.) To try one of these out, navigate
to the script in the launcher, select it, and run it.

To modify or write your own scripts, look at the documentation or
tutorial my the doc/ directory.  You can open any script (.pbl file)in
wordpad or notepad to change or edit.
