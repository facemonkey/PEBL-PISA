# This file contains the stimuli for a gist recall experiment.  There are 
# seven 'lists' containing 36 pairs each: 24 halves of each pair will
# be presented and the other half will be tested; the half of the remaining
# 12 will be tested as lures.  The first column is the word list, the second
# is the relationship type: H: hyper/hyponym (kind-of relationship), P is has-part,
# M is has-member, S is has-stuff.  In each case, the more general term is first
# and the more specific is second.
